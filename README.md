**Data Description**
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. It was obtained from a simulated student performance
survey designed to explore the relationships between study habits, motivation, and environmen-
tal factors on academic outcomes. The dimensions of our dataset are 6607 rows by 20 columns.
Variables of interest were Previous_Scores, Exam_Score, Attendance, Hours_Studied, Sleep
Hours, Tutoring Sessions, and Physical Activity. Exam_Score was our primary variable of
interest which we treated as the outcome variable. The other variables were all categorical
variables, as noted in the introduction. Previous_Scores was the result of previous academic
assessments with a maximum grade of 100. Attendance was a percentage of class sessions
attended. Tutoring sessions recorded the number of weekly tutoring sessions attended by each
student. Physical Activity measured the number of hours per week of physical activity that
were conducted by each student. Hours_Studied represents the number of hours per week a
student dedicated to studying. Sleep Hours recorded the number of hours of sleep a student
was getting per night. Parental_Involvement indicates the level of parental engagement in the
student’s education and has three levels: High, Medium, and Low. Peer_Influence represents
the degree of influence peers have on the student, categorized as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
Family_Income reflects the income level of the student’s family or father and is classified as High, Medium, or Low. Motivation_Level describes the student’s level of motivation toward
academic work, also categorized as High, Medium, or Low.
